            Product development is a multi-stage process that involves bringing a new product or service to the market. It begins with idea generation, where opportunities are identified and ideas are brainstormed. Market research is then conducted to understand customer needs, market trends, and competitors. From there, the concept is developed, including defining the product's features, functionality, and target audience. The next stage is design and prototyping, where the product's visual and physical aspects are created and tested. Once the design is finalized, the product moves into production, where manufacturing or development takes place. After production, the product undergoes rigorous testing and quality assurance. Finally, the product is launched, marketed, and distributed to the target market. Post-launch evaluation and customer feedback are crucial for continuous improvement and iteration. Throughout the process, effective project management, collaboration, and communication are key to successful product development.
